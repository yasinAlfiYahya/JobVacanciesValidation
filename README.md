### Summary:
The Covid-19 pandemic has caused some people to lose their jobs. In the data on the number of workers laid off from both the formal and informal sectors, it can be seen that the number of workers who are laid off increases abnormally. Hence, a lot of workers become unemployed. This situation raises opportunities for criminals to create fake job openings. The perpetrators use this fraudulent way to get personal information from applicants such as ID cards or other personal data that can be fatal. To reduce the occurrence of these crimes, an application called "Job Vacancy Validation" was created. Job Vacancy Validation is an application for predicting the validity of scattered job openings. This application was developed to reduce the crimes that occur due to fake job openings. With this application, it is hoped that it can help the community in defining how the right steps to check if a job vacancy falls into the valid category or not so that no more people are harmed due to fake job vacancies that are still widely spread.
